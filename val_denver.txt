Talk Title: The Spectrum of Stablecoin Permissioning, an Argument for Doubling Down on Decentralization | Slater
Speaker: Slater Heil
Text: Like why bring these on-chain, sorry, why bring these bank liabilities, these IOUs of dollars into the on-chain ecosystem? The first and foremost reason is that counterparty risk is the biggest hidden risk in all of traditional finance, right? There's the classic saying, know thy counterparty, because in stressful black swan market situations, that's really what ends up getting you, even at a large scale. When your counterparty blows up, there's not a whole lot that you can do about it, even though it generally only happens in pretty extreme black swan events. So the point of DeFi from a first principles level is that we can trade off counterparty risk for smart contract risk. Instead, we can write rules with systems that are going to self-execute and do exactly what they say they are going to do. So we no longer have to trust a counterparty to do what they say they're going to do.

Talk Title: The Spectrum of Stablecoin Permissioning, an Argument for Doubling Down on Decentralization | Slater
Speaker: Slater Heil
Text: Everybody. Thank you all for being here. I'm Slater Heil. I'm the founder of Composable Corp and a few different protocols. The one in question here being StakeUp. It's a yield-bearing stablecoin with Treasury bills as its backing. And I wanted to talk today about kind of the first principles of stablecoin. What really is a stablecoin? How does permissioning work within stablecoin systems? And how do these RWA integrations that have become very trendy lately kind of play into that permissioning spectrum? So what really is a stablecoin? I think the best analog for the regular person is kind of like a bank deposit or a bank liability. Basically, it's a system where collateral exists and carries risks of redeemability for $1 related to its mechanisms of issuance and redemption, its collateralization, and its accessibility. And those risks play out in very different ways depending on if it's a more centralized system, like a bank, or if it's a more decentralized system, like a protocol. So just to make a few examples there, right, the risks of a bank deposit are pretty clear and well understood.

Talk Title: The Spectrum of Stablecoin Permissioning, an Argument for Doubling Down on Decentralization | Slater
Speaker: Slater Heil
Text: Instead, we can guarantee we get the right output from our inputs using smart contracts. So, the big trend of the year so far has been yield-bearing stablecoins. And the reason I wanted to give this talk is because I think there's fair reason to be concerned about the decentralization trade-offs that occur for most yield-bearing stablecoin models. The trend, however, is very positive, right? The ethos of Web3 is to share value with your users as much as possible. So seeing stablecoin issuers go from a model of hoarding all the yield from the backing collateral to now sharing that yield with their users is overall a very positive trend. However, the trade-off is centralization in a lot of cases, as well as KYC constraints. So, KYC constraints, period, are, I think, generally against the ethos of Web3, but more important from the composability perspective, if your token has a whitelisted, permissioned transferring system, it just can't be compatible with DeFi, because DeFi is permissionless by nature.

You can make your smart contracts ownable, right? There is a library for that in OpenZeppelin. Many people do it. So what only owner does is that whenever a particular method gets invoked, it checks whether the message sender, which is a context variable, environment variable that we have access to in Solidity, matches the address stored in some slot. But when this happens, there is some bytecode executed, right? So users have to pay gas for it, and you actually have to code the logic into the smart contract, which, depending on what exact logic you are coding in, it can actually be a lot of code, and so on and so on. What we are doing here in this declarative language and invariants, we are essentially giving the developers the opportunity to take this thing away from smart contracts. Because in this new setting, we would allow you, through this language, to say, hey, my invariant is that this particular method can only be called if message sender equals this. And you will make that known to the sequencer without the necessity to have that bytecode present in your smart contract itself. And then the sequencer will simulate every single transaction. If it notices that it actually violates the invariant, you have the certainty that it will not ever be included in the block, which can lead to simplification of many projects.', 'speaker': 'Martin Durker', 'segment_id': 252, 'doc_id': 'TqRi5GJ9RS4.252'}]

So, KYC constraints, period, are, I think, generally against the ethos of Web3, but more important from the composability perspective, if your token has a whitelisted, permissioned transferring system, it just can't be compatible with DeFi, because DeFi is permissionless by nature.

Okay, so if you want to know that some data is available on Celestia on your EVM chain, which we'll use Ethereum in this example, how would you do it? Well, like many bridges, you need to run a light client off the Celestia chain in the EVM. And how do you run a like client? You have a smart contract that verifies signatures and keeps track of voting power so that whenever it is relayed a new header, it checks to see, does the header actually have enough consensus on it?

And if that collateral is sitting at a loss, there's a chance not all users are going to be made whole. So that's kind of how a traditional banking system works. There are still, of course, clear rule sets, but it's based a lot on human discretion within those rule sets, which affects the risk of actually being able to redeem for a dollar. With a protocol or a stablecoin, generally, depending on how decentralized it is, you have a much greater guarantee of redeemability, but of course it still does carry risks.

Speaker: Jacqueline Cooper
Text: Yeah. I agree with you. So first of all, a show of hands, how many of you actually have wills? Awesome. But those that don't have wills, now raise your hand. It's about 50-50. So when you do have a will, you still have to look at these parts. You have to really, and this is difficult, explicitly write down every digital asset you own. You really have to do a brain drop. And you have to specify how do you want this to be handled. Because I've had many conversations with individuals about whether the asset should be held or liquefied. And if you're not around and you don't give those details or those instructions in the will, then your executor or your family, who might not know anything about these assets, they might say, well, let's just sell it. And it might not be the best time to sell. So the other thing that we mentioned is how to access that, and we're going to be talking about that, as well as what should be done. So I know that Matthew Rogers, Amber Welch, and Laura Cole, there are a lot of different pieces to this. What do you think is the most important of this laundry list that we have here?

Your attorney who writes your will might not want to be the keeper of the keys. I know a lot of wills, trusts, and estates attorneys that seek out my help, they don't want to be the custodian. They don't want that burden, that stress of trying to maintain that. You need a document that says what you have, and then you need a separate document or ability to get to that, because you don't want to have them necessarily in the same document, depending on who the fiduciary of your estate is.

Text: I think people should evaluate, like, where on your priority list of things to do is this? So you could rank it on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm pretty busy today. Have I updated my digital asset repository and database? No, probably haven't. But first of all, be thinking to yourself, how high a priority is this for you? If you have children and heirs and a significant amount of crypto, it's probably fairly high on your priority list. And then if it is a higher priority list and you want to start like chiseling away at how you're going to address it, right? And really what are all those digital assets? Because previously they might have been called things like intangibles, right? A bunch of things that were unknown or some value in a name or some goodwill. The value of the goodwill or entitlements, that can all... Like there may be a lot of future, we all already know this, sort of future benefits sometimes to participating in these networks. So your wallet may have received a certain amount of benefits and be it from an airdrop or some other way you participated in something and maybe there's a future benefit or entitlement, those things would be thought through as well.

And so that's an unacceptably long time and delay for good UX and for unified liquidity.", 'speaker': 'SPEAKER_23', 'segment_id': 206, 'doc_id': 'XoyvZxOe4Ww.206'}, {'episode_id': 'wePegGHDNv4', 'episode_title': 'Unlocking the Past: Building Trustless dApps With Relic | Tim Becker - ChainLight', 'episode_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wePegGHDNv4', 'created_at': '2024-02-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'company_name': 'Chainlight', 'segment_start_time': 131.801, 'segment_end_time': 215.007, 'text': "And just as a simple motivating example, we can say, what if your contract wanted to know who owned this Pudgy Penguin at block 15 million? So this is a very simple question you can ask an RPC provider like Infera or Alchemy, and of course you can also query any archive node, and they'll be able to answer this question for you very easily. But if you were to pick a random node on the Ethereum network, you would instead get this horrible error message about some missing tri-node, and it will completely fail to answer this question. And the reason for that is that on Ethereum, old data is pruned away for most nodes. It's only required that nodes keep the current state of the chain. And so once the data gets old enough and is finalized, most nodes will prune it away to reduce disk space and make it easier to run nodes. But if you look at how this data is actually stored, so basically everything of interest is either in the block header or in a Merkle-Patricia tri, which is committed to by the block header. And this includes all of the account balances, all of the storage, transactions, logs, everything. And because it's in this Merkle Patricia tri, which is kind of like a Merkle tree, you can generate very short proofs of any data in the tree that you want relative to the size of the tree.", 'speaker': 'Tim Becker', 'segment_id': 2, 'doc_id': 'wePegGHDNv4.2'}]
