A message is meaningful if it is self-contained with valuable information, for example, it can be an announcement, a news, an instruction about code, or a opinion towards a subnet.
A message is meaningless if it contains no valuable information or is a piece of conversation taken out of contexts.
For example, meaningless messages can be a question without context, a response to an unknown question, log without explanation, code without context, very short messages, or an announcement from six months ago.
Note even if a message itself is informative, it should still be categorized into meaningless if it is part of a conversation or lacks context to understand the information based on the message itself.

Text: Also driving the charm is Blast's unique design: Depositors start earning yields on the transferred ether alongside BLAST points. "Blast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2's users and dapps," the team said in a post Tuesday. 'We've redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time, it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically."
As such, Blast is invite-only as of Tuesday, requiring a code from invited users to gain access. Besides, the BLAST points can be redeemed starting in May.Blast raised over $20 million in a round led by Paradigm and Standard Crypto and is headed by pseudonymous figurehead @PacmanBlur, one of the co-founders of NFT marketplace Blur.
@PacmanBlur said in a separate post that Blast was an extension of the Blur ecosystem, letting Blur users earn yields on idle assets while improving the technical aspects required to offer sophisticated NFT products to users.
BLUR prices rose 12%% in the past 24 hours following the release of Blast
